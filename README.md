# BlogWorld

This is the BlogWorld Repository created to offer source code access to students taking my Django 1.11 lecture in 2018 Winter.

## About Me

I am KeonSunKim. Graduated Sogang University Bachelor Program with an Economics and Sociology Degree. 

Currently undergoing my Masters Program in Sogang University Sociology Department. I also work at a startup "Greedy Turtles" in Seoul, Korea as a backend web developer. 

If you want to contact me, contact me through my email given in my course plan.

## Before Getting Started

My course is mainly based for programmers with entry level, and intermediate level understanding of Python. The course was mainly offered to students in CEOS and Sogang University. This course was offered with the purpose of donating talent, and this is my first attempt at teaching Django 1.11. Be merciful!

* Note!! 

The lecture schedule did not go as planned therefore did not strictly follow the course plan.
