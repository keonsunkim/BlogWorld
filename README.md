# BlogWorld

This is the BlogWorld Repository created to offer source code access to students taking my Django 1.11 lecture in 2018 Winter.

## Before Getting Started

My course is mainly based for programmers with entry level, and intermediate level understanding of Python. The course was mainly offered to students in CEOS and Sogang University. This course was offered with the purpose of donating talent, and this is my first attempt at teaching Django 1.11. Be merciful!
